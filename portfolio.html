    <p style="font-size: 25px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        Born and raised in the country of Jamaica, I am currently 19 years old and attending the University
        of Maryland USA. As a kid I always had big dreams to help others and solve issues which were going 
        around the world. As a result, my CS journey began with a book of inventions which I keep to this
        day. These inventions were first realized with a World Robotics Olympiad in Jamaica. I was attending
        Hillel Academy at the time and we placed second. It was exilirating. The thrill I got from participating
        in the competition, made me realize that this was what I wanted to do, and further cemented my path
        to becoming a computer science student. Subsequently I ended up joining the computer science club at
        my school and then finally pursuing a degree of computer science in the University of Maryland.

        In regards to other aspects of my life apart from CS, I tend to enjoy reading, exercising, playing
        the piano, journaling, playing video games and watching informational videos. I also have a passion
        for leading, speaking and helping others, as can be seen by the things listed in my resume where I founded
        the peer counselor organization in my school, delivering a welcome speech for the governor general of
        Jamaica and taking on several leadership positions at my high school.
